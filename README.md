# Fixed Size Stack Implementation

This is a simple fixed-size stack implementation in Java. It provides basic stack operations such as push, pop, and displayStack.

## Features

- **Push**: Add an element to the top of the stack.
- **Pop**: Remove and return the element from the top of the stack.
- **DisplayStack**: Display all elements in the stack.
- **Overflow Check**: Check if the stack is full before pushing elements.
- **Underflow Check**: Check if the stack is empty before popping elements.

# Growable Size Stack Implementation

This is a stack implementation in Java that dynamically grows in size when needed. It provides basic stack operations such as push, pop, and displayStack.

## Features

- **Push**: Add an element to the top of the stack.
- **Pop**: Remove and return the element from the top of the stack.
- **DisplayStack**: Display all elements in the stack.
- **Underflow Check**: Check if the stack is empty before popping elements.
- **Overflow**: This stack implementation does not have a fixed size, so the overflow condition is not applicable.

- # Stack Interface

This is a simple interface for stack implementations in Java. It defines the basic stack operations such as push, pop, displayStack, isOverflow, and isUnderflow.

## Interface Methods

- **push(int element)**: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
- **pop() -> int**: Removes and returns the element from the top of the stack.
- **displayStack()**: Displays all elements in the stack.
- **isOverflow() -> boolean**: Checks if the stack is full.
- **isUnderflow() -> boolean**: Checks if the stack is empty.

# Result Class Implementation

The `Result` class extends the `Student` class and implements the `Exam` interface to calculate and display the result of a student.

## Features

- **percent_cal()**: Calculates the percentage of marks obtained by the student based on the marks in three exams.
- **display()**: Displays the student's details along with the calculated result.
